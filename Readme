First, I create a simple threadless script. This script will add three numbers (12, 2 and 3) to the list and add them to the list.
The function that adds numbers to the list sleeps a number of seconds equal to the number we add.
The result of the script is simply 17 (12 + 2 + 3) and when we sleep the script, the number of seconds is equal to the number that we add to our script.
It' takes 17 seconds to finish.

I used the threading version of the script. I did the same thing
But one thread has been used for each append (with the same sleep function)
The result of our script is 17 again, but it takes 12 seconds (the highest sleep).
